as a past startup founder i know firsthand how hard it can be to recruit and hire the right talent and after going through my first layoff experience this year i been thinking a lot about how companies hire in my newest thought piece for mission i explore a new model for bringing in talent to accelerate product development while cutting fixed costs fractional teams read the full article at the link below to find out why fractional teams are the secret to layoff proof hiring in,1
imagine that instead of painstakingly hiring one individual at a time you were able to hire an entire team flexibly scaling their hours up and down based on the stage of product development you in wait did we just figure out a layoff proof model for team the predicament slower growth higher interest rates and diminished consumer spending are forcing companies to exercise a lot more caution as they undergo their headcount planning but they still need to build high growth products to hit their goals what if they designed their companies the current economic climate top founders are bringing in the talent they need to accelerate product development while actually saving on costs the secret instead of hiring full time they deploying fractional teams with fractional hiring founders can deploy a specialized fractional team that already worked together before and is perfectly suited to build what they need to build instead of painstakingly hiring individuals and forming them into a team over a month period if you look at the layoff messaging from the ceos of stripe meta and apple they all had a common narrative they gotten ahead of themselves with hiring amidst the economic boom and grew their workforce too fast if they had instead kept a smaller core staff of ftes and supplemented them with fractional teams based on the initiatives at hand would the outcomes be teams might just be the answer to layoff proof hiring in the full article,0

shame on doordash for laying people off via email i know they laid off a lot of people but at least set up some zoom meetings or something treat people like people been thinking a lot about how many people worked hard for their employers prior to being laid off they put in the extra hours pushed through days packed with meetings logged in on weekends to meet deadlines and push out offers they rose to challenges stepping outside their comfort zones and learning the skills needed to get the job done and to think that after all of that no one had time to break the news to their face it not okay it become way too easy for companies to casually carelessly discard people like they mean nothing we need to do better,0
